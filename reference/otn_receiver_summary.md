## No files provided

If you only provide your project code and leave all of the arguments as
their defaults, this function will ask you to log in then proceed to
download all of the necessary files. You can speed up this process
substantially by providing already-downloaded files.

## Output

This function creates an HTML report that can be viewed in your web
browser.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Using only the project code:
otn_receiver_summary("tailwinds")

# Providing a local file:
otn_receiver_summary("tailwinds", deployment = "my_master_deployment_metadata.xlsx")

# Get a summary fo what has changed since a particular date:
otn_receiver_summary("tailwinds", since = "2022-05-01")
} # }
```
